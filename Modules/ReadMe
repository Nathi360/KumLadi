Requires: node.js
	  monogoDB

To start the project:
1. Open you terminal
2. In the folder with the project, type: "npm install" (requires internet access)
3. Open another terminal window and type: "mongod" (starts mongodb)
4. Back in the first terminal, type: "npm start" (starts the project)

To test, I used Postman (an API testing suite). Its free to download (See included screenshots for testing in postman)
